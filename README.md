# rusty-tork

### Patch Notes: v0.1.2.2

#### Changes

- Room pathways are now defined with the rest of the room definition, instead of in a separate section
- The number of rooms no longer needs to be defined, only the rooms themselves
- Defining a pathway with an ID that does not have an associated room now provides a warning to the user

#### Bug Fixes
- (Deprecated)Defining less rooms than is declared no longer causes the program to crash
